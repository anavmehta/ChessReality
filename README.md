In times of Covid19 lockdown, I present a fun and innovative way to get kids and adults to learn chess via Augmented Reality and MultiPeer play by interacting with a virtual system in a real environment. ChessReality is a unique rendition of Augmented Reality chess which makes playing chess fun. A tap places a virtual chessboard and pieces on a physical horizontal surface, perhaps on the floor of your living room or your dining table. The game is played with a single device or with a computer which uses an Open Source engine StockFish, or with another player using another device (on the same WiFi or BlueTooth network) with MultiPeer Synchronization. running ChessReality. (Note: the MultiPeer feature works faster with new iPhones with devices A12 and A12X). 

When you open the app, on the top menu bar from left to right, three modes are available. 

“Single device”: a single device used to play both white and black. In this mode, a single device is used to play white and black, alternating every move. Feature debug points are shown on a horizontal surface which stabilizes after which a tap places a 20cmx20cm chessboard. The first tap selects and highlights the possible moves by the piece. The second tap places the selected piece.  The bulb hint button can be used, which uses the chess engine to provide the best move.

“Play With Computer”: the play alternates between the user and computer, In this mode, a user plays with the computer, powered by the chess engine.

“Play With Opponent”: devices on the same WiFi network or Bluetooth connect in peer mode. One player places the board and starts the play.   The play information is exchanged using MultiPeer messages and the Augmented Reality overlay is updated. A hint button can be used in this mode as well. . 

Below the top menu options are a label view showing the current state and an information label that provides status and updates. The moves in Algebraic notation and the FEN string of the state of the board are shown at the bottom bar. This is also useful for chess learners to understand the notation and formats which are used to record moves.

There are thousands of chess apps, but this a unique app in that it works in an AR/VR environment and is a new method for learning chess.
