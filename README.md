# ChessReality
Collection of topics
In times of Covid19 lockdown, I present a fun and innovative way to get kids and adults to learn chess via Augmented Reality and Multipeer play by interacting with a virtual system in a real environment. ChessReality is a unique rendition of Augmented Reality chess which makes playing chess fun. A tap places a virtual chessboard and pieces on a physical horizontal surface, perhaps on the floor of your living room or your dining table. The game is played with a single device or with a computer using an Open Source engine StockFish, or with another player using another device (on the same WiFi or BlueTooth network) with Multipeer Synchronization. running ChessReality. (Note: the third MultiPeer feature works faster with new iPhones with devices A12 and A12X)
